In this data set, I work with airbnb data in San Francisco, and plot the map of all AirBnB listings in SF. 
the data set has 75 variables and 6566 observations. Variables include price, property type, room type, number of reviews, etc.  


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# leave this chunk alone
options(knitr.table.format = "html") 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, 
  comment = NA, dpi = 300)
```


```{r load-libraries, echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # the usual stuff: dplyr, readr, and other goodies
library(lubridate) # to handle dates
library(GGally) # for correlation-scatter plot matrix
library(ggfortify) # to produce residual diagnostic plots
library(rsample) # to split dataframe in training- & testing sets
library(janitor) # clean_names()
library(broom) # use broom:augment() to get tidy table with regression output, residuals, etc
library(huxtable) # to get summary table of all models produced
library(kableExtra) # for formatting tables
library(moderndive) # for getting regression tables
library(skimr) # for skim
library(mosaic)
library(leaflet) # for interactive HTML maps
library(tidytext)
library(viridis)
library(vroom)
```

```{r load_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# use cache=TRUE so you dont donwload the data everytime you knit

listings <- vroom("http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ca/san-francisco/2021-10-06/data/listings.csv.gz") %>% 
       clean_names()

```


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)



We start off by answering a few questions about the data based on data wrangling done below: 
- How many variables/columns? How many rows/observations?
*The data has 75 variables and 6566 observations 
- Which variables are numbers?
*37 variables are numbers, as shown by the list below. In this answer we assume that dates are not numbers.
- Which are categorical or *factor* variables (numeric or character variables with variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values?
*22 categorical variables 
- What are the correlations between variables? Does each scatterplot support a linear relationship between variables? Do any of the correlations appear to be conditional on the value of a categorical variable?

## Data wrangling 

The first step is to view the data and eliminate any non numeric data points so data visualization does not return errors  
```{r, warning=FALSE}
#data type
glimpse(listings)
#drops any non-numeric characters in price
listings <- listings %>% 
  mutate(price = parse_number(price)) 
```

 Confirming that `price` is now stored as a number.
```{r}
#check price is a number
typeof(listings$price)
```

We skim for missing data and check some statistics for price and accommodates variable 
```{r,cache=TRUE}
#filter for missing / skim data 
favstats(~price,data=listings) #favstats for price
favstats(~accommodates,data=listings) #favstats for accommodates (# of people)

listings%>%
  skim() %>%
  filter(n_missing > 0)
```
From price, we see that the data is probably very skewed towards the right, given its mean is almost at Q3. 
For accommodates, we see that the variable is probably also skewed towards the right, with most airbnb's accommodating 2 people 

## Propery types

I am now owkring with the property type variable and observing which are the most common and what percentage of all listing do they make up.

Since the most of the observations in the data are one of the top four or five property types,  a simplified version of `property_type` is created and is categorized intothe top four categories and `Other`. 

```{r}
number_listings <- listings %>%
  group_by(property_type) %>%
  count(sort=TRUE) %>%
  kable(format = "html") %>%
  kable_classic()
number_listings

#sum(number_listings$n)
```
*The top 4 most common property types are Entire rental unit, Private room in residential home, Entire residential home, Entire condominium (condo). They make up 4103/6566 = 0.625 of the total listings.*

```{r}
listings <- listings %>%
  mutate(prop_type_simplified = case_when(
    property_type %in% c("Entire rental unit","Private room in residential home", "Entire residential home","Entire condominium (condo)") ~ property_type, 
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))
  
```

Checking that `prop_type_simplified` was correctly made.

```{r}
listings %>%
  count(property_type, prop_type_simplified) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))        
```        
Now we have 5 distinct property types under `prop_type_simplified` 


## Number of nights 
Airbnb is most commonly used for travel purposes, i.e., as an alternative to traditional hotels. I wanted to filter out all the data points for travel purposes only

```{r}
#most common value for minimum_nights
listings %>%
  group_by(minimum_nights) %>%
  count(sort=TRUE) %>%
  kable(format = "html") %>%
  kable_classic()
```

- It can be seen that most common values for the variable `minimum_nights` are *30, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5*
- Among the common values  *30 is evidently larger than others*
- The likely intended purpose for Airbnb listings with this seemingly unusual value for `minimum_nights` is *to induce users to stay longer to reduce moving, cleaning and marketing costs*

Filter the airbnb data so that it only includes observations with `minimum_nights <= 4`
```{r}
#filter for data with less than 4 nights minimum 
listings_1 <- listings %>%
  filter(minimum_nights <= 4)
```


## Creating Visualizations to Examine Data

```{r}
#histogram (price)
listings%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=price),binwidth=5)+
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Price vs. Count")

#plot with price less than 1000 
listings %>%
  filter(price<=1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=price),binwidth=10) +
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title="Price Under 1000 vs. Count",x="price under 1000")
  NULL
```

Most listings in San Francisco lie between $50 and $1000. There are a few outliers that go up to $10000. However, it can be seen in the histogram displaying listings below $1000 that majority of the listings are below $250 per night.

```{r}
#plot for property_type vs average price 
listings %>%
  group_by(prop_type_simplified)%>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=prop_type_simplified,y=avg_price))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "Property Type vs. Average Price",x="property type",y="average price")

```
The bar graph displays average price by the type of listing. It helps us see what kind of properties will have a higher price overall. Entire residential homes have highest prices as these properties will have more amenities and space, while a room within a home have lowest average price due to lower privacy and luxury.
